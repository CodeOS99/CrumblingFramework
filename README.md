# Crumbling Framework

Hello, developer. I hope you can finish my game for me.

This game is currently super unfinished, like ironically the game's whole thing was supposed to be that it was incomplete as a joke and the main dev forgot to make it.

But its kind of true right now, the game is almost completely incomplete. 

I want to add more tasks(with more depth, currently this game can also be called press E simulator) and some form of actual progression.
